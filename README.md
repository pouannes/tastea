This is a personal project built as a tool for me and my partner to keep track of our teas. We love our teas!

It's also a way for me to learn, experiment and get better with different tools and technologies.

[The project is being hosted here by Vercel.](https://tastea.vercel.app/)

## Tool used

Those are the tools I used:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the JS framework
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) for the SQL-based backend
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for my css (I also used a bit of [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) components, by the creators of tailwindcss)
- typescript (it's my first real typescript project)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) to handle form logic, and [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for form schema validation
- [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) to handle the fuzzy search
